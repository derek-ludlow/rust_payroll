# Overview

I have created a simple payroll management system to help me learn the fundamentals of the Rust programming language. I 
had heard so much about Rust, so it was really cool to do alot of research into it and write a little bit of code in it as well! There are several really cool things about Rust, and I have detailed some of those things I learned as I did research in the "rust_research" file in this repository. I was unable to find a straightforward and free solution for implementing this program with a functioning database for this phase of the program. So, the functional code is found in the 'payroll_nodb' folder and the other folders are some trial and error/non-functional additional stuff.

# Development Environment

I created this program working out of the Visual Studio Code code editor, along with utilizing git and github as well.

I wrote this program in the Rust programming language, and some of the libraries I implemented included the 'Diesel' library for ORM (Object-Relational Mapping).

# Future Work

Things that I would like to fix, improve, and add in the future:

- Finding a free solution to the database issue so I do not have to take up local space, and create a database for the program.
- More error handling
- Create some RESTful APIs using something like Actix or Rocket in order to make the program a web application that users could access through their browser.
